Some of the icons you see in the enclosed             collection have come from late night sketch-sessions, some have come             from contract work that never went anywhere. The majority of them             however were designed just for this release, especially all of the             U.S. related ones.<br>            <br>            As we write this, it has been a little over two weeks since the tragic             terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington D.C.. Almost immediately             afterwards, we started receiving e-mail asking if we would make some             icons of American flags or knew where people could download them.             It seems that displaying a flag on your home or car simply wasn't             enough anymore. Many people wanted to proudly display flags on their             desktop as well. We are only too happy to help out in this respect             and have created several flag icons as well as a few other appropriate             patriotic items in the Copland style.<br>            <br>            We hope you enjoy our latest creation for pre-Mac OS X users. The             World of Copland series has been one of our most successful to date,             and helped get The Iconfactory where it is today. We're proud to be             able to continue the collection, and we hope you'll take a moment             to remember all the people who lost their lives on September 11th.             We dedicate this icon collection to them, and hope it will make your             day just a bit brighter. Enjoy.<br>            <br>            <span class="coloredbold"><span class="boldtext"><strong>Thanks</strong>:</span></span>             Go out to all the brave men and women who risked their lives in the             performance of their duties in New York and in Washington D.C. on             September 11th, 2001. None of us will ever forget you or what you             did to help complete strangers try and stay out of harm's way. To             these, and all of the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks,             go our thoughts, prayers and thanks.<br>            <br>          </p>          </td>					</tr>				</table>				<br>				<table width="180" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0">					<tr>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="120" height="10" border="0"></td>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="15" height="10" border="0"></td>						<td><img src="images/10space.gif" alt="" width="450" height="10" border="0"></td>					</tr>					<tr>						<td align="right" valign="top"><span class="boldbody">Legality</span></td>						<td></td>						        <td>These icons and the images represented by these icons are Copyright           &copy;2001 The Iconfactory.
